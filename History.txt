== 0.6.2 2019-03-01

  * extending Integer instead of Fixnum, because Fixnum is deprecated in Ruby 2.4

== 0.6.1 2017-07-10

* 1 tiny bugfix:
  * removing timely requirement, since it depends on activesupport and turning a date to a time is pretty easy

== 0.6.0 2012-04-10

* 1 minor enhancement:
  * adding 'entry' command:
    * combines in+out into one command, requiring from (in) and to (out) times
    * has 'clock' alias

== 0.5.1 2012-03-19

* 1 tiny bugfix:
  * short status no longer errors under 1.9.2 when all projects are punched out

== 0.5.0 2010-11-18

* 1 minor enhancement:
  * added 'age' command
    * moves project data to an old-version name, e.g. project -> project_old/1
    * cascades old-version project data, e.g. project -> project_old/1, project_old/1 -> project_old/2
    * can take a :before option to only move a subset of data

== 0.4.2 2010-08-16

* 1 tiny enhancement:
  * adding some date handling for list/total/summary:
    * can now take an :on option, to restrict the operation to the given date
    * option can be given on command-line with --on
    * :before and :after can also take dates now, converting them to times

== 0.4.1 2009-08-26

* 1 tiny enhancement:
  * allowing command-line log message to be specified with --message
    (will take precedence over normal message argument if both are specified)

== 0.4.0 2009-08-17

* 1 minor enhancement:
  * added 'summary' command
    * shows a breakdown of time spent on a project, using the times in log messages to indicate activities
    * accepts before/after options
* 1 tiny enhancement
  * full status now includes the last log message if the project is punched in
* 1 tiny bugfix
  * full status now works with "short" (only display what's punched-in) instead of always showing 'out'

== 0.3.3 2009-06-25

* 1 tiny enhancement:
  * added 'short' status, which only displays what's currently punched in (or 'out' if nothing)
    * punch command displays status as YAML if it's a hash, like it does for total

== 0.3.2 2009-06-01

* 1 tiny bugfix enhancement:
  * sub-projects now truly restricting to the naming form of 'parent/child',
    not 'parent_child' or even simply 'parentseriouslythisisnotachild'

* 1 tiny bugfix enhancement:
  * Total no longer erroring on non-existent parent project

== 0.3.0 2009-04-05

* 1 minor enhancement:
  * Can now have 'sub-projects', or projects with names of the form 'parent/child'
    * A parent will be checked in if a child is checked in
    * Punching out of a parent project will punch the real checked-in project out
    * Listing time and getting totals for a parent project will include child time
  * Some small convenience methods probably nobody cares about, so they aren't included in the total number of enchancements above

== 0.2.4 2008-12-17

* 1 tiny enhancement:
  * Status can now be retrieved as simple (only the status) or 'full' (status + time)
    * punch command displays status as YAML unless only retrieving simple status for a single project

== 0.2.3 2008-12-11

* 1 enhancement:
  * Logging a message now automatically adds a time
    * A time can be specified for the log message (with now as a default)
    * punch command takes options for message logging

== 0.2.2 2008-12-01

    (thanks to Rick Bradley for finding this problem)

== 0.2.1 2008-11-20

* 1 enhancement:
  * A missing or empty .punch.yml file no longer causes an exception
    (thanks to Jamie van Dyke for finding this problem)

== 0.2.0 2008-11-05

* 2 enhancements:
  * Ensures data is loaded when needed
  * Can be instantiated with a project (useful if many operations are to be performed on a single project)

== 0.1.4 2008-10-23

* punch command enhancements:
  * can now list data (outputs as YAML)
  * will output status as YAML if giving status of all projects
  * will output total as YAML if giving total of all projects

== 0.1.3 2008-09-30

* 3 enhancements:
  * Punching in and out can take a time (with now as a default)
  * Punching in and out can take a message (in addition to the auto-generated time-based message)
  * punch command options for in/out time and message

== 0.1.2 2008-08-28

* 1 tiny enhancement:
  * Repackaging to include the fixnum "elapsed time" stuff I stupidly left out of the release earlier today

== 0.1.1 2008-08-28

* 3 enhancements:
  * Can format total time as "elapsed time" instead of only getting the number of seconds
  * punch command gives improved output for some commands:
    * in/out/log: either silent or gives a message explaining a failure
    * total: shows "elapsed time" instead of number of seconds

    * total
* 1 change:
  * Data-changing operations no longer automatically write the data
