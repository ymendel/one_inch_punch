== 0.6.0 2012-04-10

* 1 minor enhancement:
  * adding 'entry' command:

    * has 'clock' alias

== 0.5.1 2012-03-19

* 1 tiny bugfix:
  * short status no longer errors under 1.9.2 when all projects are punched out

== 0.5.0 2010-11-18

* 1 minor enhancement:
  * added 'age' command
    * moves project data to an old-version name, e.g. project -> project_old/1
    * cascades old-version project data, e.g. project -> project_old/1, project_old/1 -> project_old/2
    * can take a :before option to only move a subset of data

== 0.4.2 2010-08-16

* 1 tiny enhancement:
  * adding some date handling for list/total/summary:
    * can now take an :on option, to restrict the operation to the given date
    * option can be given on command-line with --on
    * :before and :after can also take dates now, converting them to times

== 0.4.1 2009-08-26

* 1 tiny enhancement:
  * allowing command-line log message to be specified with --message
    (will take precedence over normal message argument if both are specified)

== 0.4.0 2009-08-17

* 1 minor enhancement:
  * added 'summary' command
    * shows a breakdown of time spent on a project, using the times in log messages to indicate activities
    * accepts before/after options
* 1 tiny enhancement
  * full status now includes the last log message if the project is punched in
* 1 tiny bugfix
  * full status now works with "short" (only display what's punched-in) instead of always showing 'out'

== 0.3.3 2009-06-25

* 1 tiny enhancement:
  * added 'short' status, which only displays what's currently punched in (or 'out' if nothing)
    * punch command displays status as YAML if it's a hash, like it does for total

== 0.3.2 2009-06-01

* 1 tiny bugfix enhancement:

    not 'parent_child' or even simply 'parentseriouslythisisnotachild'

* 1 tiny bugfix enhancement:
  * Total no longer erroring on non-existent parent project

* 1 minor enhancement:
  * Can now have 'sub-projects', or projects with names of the form 'parent/child'
    * A parent will be checked in if a child is checked in
    * Punching out of a parent project will punch the real checked-in project out
    * Listing time and getting totals for a parent project will include child time
  * Some small convenience methods probably nobody cares about, so they aren't included in the total number of enchancements above

== 0.2.4 2008-12-17

* 1 tiny enhancement:
  * Status can now be retrieved as simple (only the status) or 'full' (status + time)

* 1 enhancement:
  * A missing or empty .punch.yml file no longer causes an exception
    (thanks to Jamie van Dyke for finding this problem)

== 0.2.0 2008-11-05

  * Ensures data is loaded when needed
  * Can be instantiated with a project (useful if many operations are to be performed on a single project)

  * Repackaging to include the fixnum "elapsed time" stuff I stupidly left out of the release earlier today

== 0.1.1 2008-08-28

* 3 enhancements:
  * Can format total time as "elapsed time" instead of only getting the number of seconds
  * punch command gives improved output for some commands:
    * in/out/log: either silent or gives a message explaining a failure
    * total: shows "elapsed time" instead of number of seconds

== 0.1.0 2008-08-26
